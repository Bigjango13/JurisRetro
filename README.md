# Juris Retro

## Prerequisites for modifying this mod
- JDK for Java 17 ([Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/) recommended)
- [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) (Scroll down for the free community edition, if using linux **DO NOT** use the flatpak distribution)
- Minecraft Development plugin (Optional, but highly recommended)

## Some Info
I sometimes make this mod in my free time to just add random stuff I think about. I am experienced Minecraft Mod Developer
with over 5 years of experience on the modern versions of Minecraft, but wanted to see what it's like to work an older version.

## Tips
1. If you haven't already you should join the BTA modding discord! https://discord.gg/FTUNJhswBT
